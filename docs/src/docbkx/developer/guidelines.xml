    <title>Storage Guidelines</title>
    <para>
      This section describes the guidelines where what have to be stored.
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>The role of the edb remains unchanged. It not used by endpoints to store their data.</listitem>
        <listitem>For the context and the upcoming user and accesscontrol management, I'll investigate how LDAP can
        assist. Though this pulls another big dependency into the project, it should pay off. The best solution would
        be to deploy the required LDAP-component right into servicemix.</listitem>
        <listitem>The h2-database that the config-ui is using will be replaced by a solution using eXist.</listitem>
        <listitem>The exist-util in the core will be extended to provide utility-functions to resolve data-relations.
        Requirements will be derived from porting the config-ui-database.</listitem>
        <listitem>To be more flexible on the datamodel, a structured approach (like a relational database) is not a
        good solution. The semistructered way eXist uses is more desirable considering the current requirements.</listitem>
