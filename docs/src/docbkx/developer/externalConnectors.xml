        The CSharp connector is written on basis of the Apache ActiveMQ NMS connector and with help of the Spring 
        NmsTemplate. The code is checked into the repository and could be found in <literal>openengsb/openengsb-nonjava/csharp</literal>. 
        There an EngSB.sln file. This project file had been developed with SharpDevelop3, but is also tested with
