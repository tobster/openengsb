connector-issues-trac

  This connector enables OpenEngSB to create issues on a trac instance. You will need to install the
  {{{http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin}XmlRpc Plugin}} on your trac instance.

  The connector implements following methods of the issue domain:
  
  * createIssue
  
  * addComment
  
  * updateIssue
  
  * deleteIssue
  
  []
  
  Each project will need it's own endpoint and configuration.

*Setup

**DroolsSetup

  To create rules for the issue domain you will need to add following imports to drools (edit $SERVICEMIX_HOME/data/openengsb/rulebase/{imports,globals})
  
---
import java.util.HashMap
import org.openengsb.drools.IssuesDomain
import org.openengsb.drools.model.Issue
---

---
global org.openengsb.drools.IssuesDomain issue
---

**Configuring a SU for your Project

  The connector needs some parameters to connect to your project's trac instance which are configured in the SU's xbean.xml file.
  Replace USERNAME, PASSWORD, URL, PORT, PROJECTNAME with your specific settings.
  
---
  <bean id="config" class="org.apache.xmlrpc.client.XmlRpcClientConfigImpl">
    <property name="serverURL" value="http://URL:PORT/PROJECTNAME/login/xmlrpc" />
    <property name="basicUserName" value="USERNAME" />
    <property name="basicPassword" value="PASSWORD" />
  </bean>
---

  You will also need to set a unique servicename for your project to create drool rules later.
  Replace SERVICENAME with an appropriate servicename for your Project. e.g: "tracOpenEngSBService".
  
---
  <trac:tracEndpoint service="trc:SERVICENAME" endpoint="tracEndpoint" tracConnector="#tracConnector" />
---

**Adding your endpoint to the contextstore

  Finally you will have to add your projects servicepoint to the contextstore.
  Insert following lines to the loadIssueConfig() method in contextstore.java (openengsb-core) and replace
  SERVICENAME(from the xbean.xml), CONTEXTSTORENAME.

---
  setValue("42/issue/CONTEXTSTORENAME/namespace", "urn:openengsb:trac");
  setValue("42/issue/CONTEXTSTORENAME/servicename", "SERVICENAME");
---

*Multiple Projects

  If you want to create Issues for multiple projects, you will have to create one Service-Unit per project.
  Repeat the setup for each project and be carefull to choose unique SERVICE- and CONTEXTSTORENAME's
  
*Drools example rule

  With config.setToConnector(issue, "CONTEXTSTORENAME") you can switch your projects tracConnector

**Example for creating an issue

---
when
   e : Event( name == "tracOpenEngSBcreate" )
then
   config.setToConnector(issue, "tracOpenEngSB");
   Issue i = new Issue();
   i.setSummary("Test Summary");
   i.setDescription("Test Description");
   i.setReporter("user");
   i.setPriority(Issue.priorityURGENT);
   issue.createIssue(i);
--- 

**Example for updating an issue

---
dialect 'java'
when
    e : Event( name == "tracOpenEngSBcreate" )
then
   HashMap<String, Object> changes = new HashMap<String, Object>();
   changes.put(Issue.fieldPRIORITY, Issue.priorityNORMAL);
   issue.updateIssue(2, "Update comment", changes);
